    <p>Most living animal species are in Bilateria, a clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric body plan. 
        The Bilateria include the protostomes, containing animals such as nematodes, arthropods, flatworms, annelids and molluscs, and the deuterostomes, containing the echinoderms and the chordates, the latter including the vertebrates.
         Life forms interpreted as early animals were present in the Ediacaran biota of the late Precambrian. Many modern animal phyla became clearly established in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion, which began around 539 million years ago.
          6,331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified; these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago.</p>

        <li>All animals are composed of cells, surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins.
            During development, the animal extracellular matrix forms a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganised, making the formation of complex structures possible.
             This may be calcified, forming structures such as shells, bones, and spicules.
             </li>
        <li>The most basal animals, the Porifera, Ctenophora, Cnidaria, and Placozoa,
             have body plans that lack bilateral symmetry. 
             Their relationships are still disputed; the sister group to all other animals could be the Porifera or the Ctenophora,
            both of which lack hox genes, important in body plan development</li><br>
        <li>Genetic studies have considerably changed zoologists' understanding of the relationships within the Bilateria. Most appear to belong to two major lineages,
             the protostomes and the deuterostomes.It is often suggested that the basalmost bilaterians are the Xenacoelomorpha, with all other bilaterians belonging to the subclade Nephrozoa.
             However, this suggestion has been contested, with other studies finding that xenacoelomorphs are more closely related to Ambulacraria than to other bilaterians </li>
